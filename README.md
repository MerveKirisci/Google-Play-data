# Google-Play-Project

In this project, I made a comprehensive analysis of the Android app market by comparing more than ten thousand apps on Google Play in different 
categories. I sought insights from data to design strategies to drive growth and retention.

User reviews for apps can be analyzed to determine whether the mood for that app is positive, negative, or neutral. For example, positive words in an app review might include words like "great", "friendly", "good", "awesome" and "love". Negative words can be words like "malware", "hate", "problem", 
"return" and "inadequate".

By plotting the sentiment polarity scores of user reviews for paid and free apps, we observe that free apps receive a lot of harsh reviews, as indicated by the negative y-axis outliers. Reviews for paid apps never seem overly negative. This may indicate something about app quality, i.e. paid apps are on 
average higher quality than free apps. The median polarity score for paid apps is slightly higher than for free apps, so it syncs with our previous observation.
